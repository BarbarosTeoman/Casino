## Game Rules
+ Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
+ Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
+ Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the hand more.
+ The game starts with the player placing a bet.
+ The player and dealer are both dealt two cards initially.
+ The player can choose to hit (receive another card), stand (keep their current hand), or double down (double their bet and receive one more card).
+ If the dealer's upcard is an Ace, the player can choose to place an insurance bet, which pays 2-to-1 if the dealer has a blackjack.
+ The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.
+ If either the player or the dealer goes over 21, they bust and lose the game.
+ If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a tie, and the player's bet is returned.
+ If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over, the player wins.
